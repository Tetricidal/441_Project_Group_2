Nice to meet you Alex. Let's work hard and cover for each other's weaknesses well. I see you're good with planning as well, so feel free to suggest tasks and timelines for the group. Any help in coordinating the team will be greatly appreciated.

Well met, Nargis. Welcome to the team. I share in your timidity but let's make an effort to get along nonetheless. It seems we're all strong planners so this team should be able to coordinate tasks and timelines well if we communicate.

Nargis — 24/08/2022
Hi Shaka

Thanks! Oh yeah definitely!
[21:28]
Maybe we should meet this weekend if possible to start discussing the project. What y’all say?
[21:29]
So we already start the planning and designing.

I shot an email over to the professor to see if or how a game can fit in the confines of software engineering. I read the first page of our textbook and it looks like we're going to have to be very creative about our proposal and idea if we want a game to pass the inspection.
[21:36]
Once we have a guage on the professors outlook we'll be able to plan in more detail.

Nargis — 24/08/2022
OK, let’s see.

Shaka / Tetris — 24/08/2022
I agree with having the meeting this weekend though. We'll see if everyone else is free and hopefully get the ghost member Heather to join.

Alex — 25/08/2022
I'm available this weekend.  This sunday I just have a meeting 11-1pm central.

Shaka / Tetris — 25/08/2022
Alright. You're not a morning person and Nargis is used to getting off of work around 5pm so we may end up as an evening crew.
[10:13]
Whether we go for Saturday or Sunday will likely rely on the ghost member Heather. I sent her an email earlier so I'm hoping she will join us here soon.

Nargis — 25/08/2022
Hi guys,
During weekdays , I am available only in the evenings, but on weekends I’m available all day

Shaka / Tetris — 25/08/2022
Noted. I'll keep that under consideration when scheduling meetings. Thanks for the clarification.

Nargis — 25/08/2022
Did we get a response from the professor on whether we could do a game or not ?

Shaka / Tetris — 25/08/2022
It's over in the planning channel. Take a peek.

Great reference material. This will be helpful even for my INF651 course since that's also using git.

Welcome to the team, Heather. It's great to see we have a strong web designer on the team. Just yesterday we were discussing the possibility of implementing a project website. Alex has listed web development as well, so you two may want to start discussing whether a web page is one of the features we'd like to include in our project.

HeatherNicoleVroman — Yesterday at 15:36
Thank you! I would love to do the website honestly I’m a former art student too so yeah I love that stuff
