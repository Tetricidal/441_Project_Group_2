Shaka / Tetris — 23/08/2022
This week's task is basically an introduction. The only difference is that we will be trying to highlight important, project relevant information about ourselves. This will concern things like our preferred languages, meeting times, etc. I will create an outline of the format I expect. I want everyone to stick to the format rather strictly, but I will add an optional section if you believe there's other relevant information about yourself that doesn't fit in the outlined categories.
